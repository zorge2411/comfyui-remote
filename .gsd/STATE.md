- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Session Goal**: Completed Phase 77

## Achievements

- [x] Implemented Phase 77
  - [x] Updated `MainViewModel.syncHistory` to support `maxItemsOverride`.
  - [x] Added `FilterChip` quick-sync row to `GalleryScreen`.
  - [x] Implemented presets for 50, 500, Today, and Deep Sync (2000).
- [x] Implemented Phase 76 (Configurable Sync History Limit)
  - [x] Added `max_sync_items` preference (default 100).
  - [x] Added UI slider in Settings (Range 100-2000).
  - [x] Updated sync logic to respect user preference.
- [x] Debugged Metadata Logs (Confirmed harmless).
- [x] Implemented Phase 75 (MP4 Video Support)
  - [x] Added `coil-video` for thumbnail frame extraction.
  - [x] Updated `MainViewModel` sync logic to recognize `gifs` and `videos` node output keys.
  - [x] Refactored `ShareUtils` to support sharing any media file directly via binary stream (binary-safe).
  - [x] Updated `StorageUtils` with comprehensive video/image MIME types.
  - [x] Enabled loop playback in the full-screen video player.
- [x] Verified Phase 70 (Subgraph Expansion) - New unit tests passed (2/2)
- [x] Verified Phase 73 (Batch Generation) - Implementation confirmed
- [x] Verified Phase 74 (Local Queue) - Navigation gap closed, Logic confirmed
- [x] Cleaned up `ROADMAP.md` (Removed duplicate/corrupted lines)

## Context & Decisions

- **Phase 77**: Integrated `FilterChip` presets in the Gallery top section. This provides low-friction access to different sync depths and ranges without menu diving.
- **Phase 76**: User requested configurable sync limit. Implemented as a slider in settings.
- **Phase 75**: Discovered that video workflows (like AnimateDiff) often output to `gifs` or `videos` keys on the server. Updated sync logic to handle these keys. Refactored sharing to be binary-safe (no more Bitmap-only sharing).
- **Phase 70**: Logic was found pre-existing in `GraphToApiConverter`. Verified correctness with a new test suite.

## Recent Updates

- **2026-02-08**: Added Phase 78 (Clear Gallery and History View to Match Server) to roadmap.

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 78**: Plan and implement functionality to clear local data and sync with server state.
2. **Verify** all recent completions once more on a physical device (Manual verification of UI layout).
3. **Project Complete?** Check for any remaining polish or edge cases.
